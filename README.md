# GeoAppExample
Simple app demonstrating some key basic features (REST API, Error handling, OperationQueue, dynamic UI etc) in the context of a MVVM architecure.
Unit tests and UITests coverage.
The app uses NATIVE frameworks, with the only exception of the LightOperations framework that I wrote. The releated files are already linked in this project, so you can simply download this repo and run!
